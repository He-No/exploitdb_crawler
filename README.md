# exploitdb_crawler

### Info

Using searchsploit, this crawler automates the search process to vulnerable software within a network. It is possible to list every piece of software implemented/discovered somewhere in the network, generate an all-in-one report and get notified as soon as a program turns into a security weakness.

This tool gathers its information from @offensive-security/exploitdb and https://www.exploit-db.com/.

# exploitdb_crawler

### Info

Using searchsploit, this crawler automates the search process to vulnerable software within a network. It is possible to list every piece of software implemented/discovered somewhere in the network, generate an all-in-one report and get notified as soon as a program turns into a security weakness.

This tool gathers its information from @offensive-security/exploitdb and https://www.exploit-db.com/. 


### Usage

1. Put all (implemented/discovered) applications in `data.txt`
2. Set permissions using the command `chmod +x exploitdb-crawler.run`
3. Run the script using the command `./exploitdb-crawler.run`
4. Consult `report.txt` to list all vulnerabilities


### TODO
